        <p>1.2 EACH PARTICIPANT IS REQUIRED TO READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO THESE RULES AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE TOURNAMENT RULES PRIOR TO, AND AS A CONDITION TO, PARTICIPATING IN A TOURNAMENT. THESE RULES FORM A CONTRACT BETWEEN EACH PARTICIPANT, ON THE ONE HAND, AND ACTIVISION PUBLISHING, INC. (THE “ADMINISTRATION”), ON THE OTHER HAND.</p>
        <p>1.3 THESE RULES AND ALL DISPUTES RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE TOURNAMENT ARE GOVERNED BY A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS IN SECTION 12 AS WELL AS LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND RELEASE PROVISIONS IN SECTION 10.  THESE CLAUSES AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES, AND YOU SHOULD REVIEW THEM CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCEPTING THESE RULES.</p>
        <p>1.4 If any provision of these Rules is or becomes illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, that shall not affect the validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any other provision of these Rules or the validity or enforceability in other jurisdictions of any other provision of these Rules.</p>
        <p>1.5 Violation of these Rules or any other applicable rules may subject a Participant to discipline, including, but not limited to Match forfeitures, prize forfeitures, fines, disqualification/removal from current and future World Championships or other Activision events and legal claims, at the Administration's sole discretion and as further described herein.</p>
        <p>1.6 Acceptance. Each Participant must agree to these Rules to participate in the Tournament. Participants may accept these Rules by any one of the following methods:</p>
        <p>Purpose. Activision Publishing, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “Activision”) created the Call of Duty®: Mobile World Championship 2024 (the “World Championship”) to serve as the fan-centric Call of Duty: Mobile (the “Game”) competition platform. The World Championship competition consists of (i) Call of Duty: Mobile online tournaments (collectively, “CODM Online Tournaments”); and (ii) Call of Duty: Mobile LAN tournaments (“CODM LAN Tournaments”, and together with the CODM Online Tournaments, the “Tournament”). These Call of Duty: Mobile World Championship Official Rules, including any updates, amendments or supplements thereto (these “Rules”) ensure the integrity of the Tournament, protect the image and reputation of Call of Duty: Mobile and the Franchise, and create a consistent and high-quality experience for spectators of the Tournaments and related events. These Rules apply to all Teams, Team Owners, Team managers, Team staff, and other individuals who are actively participating in any of the Tournaments or any event related to the Tournament, or plan to participate in any current or future event related to the Tournament (each, a “Participant”). Certain Tournaments may have additional rules, which will be posted to the Call of Duty: Mobile Website or provided to Participants before the applicable Tournament. These Rules establish the general rules of online CODM Online Tournament play and in-person CODM LAN Tournament activities, including rules governing Participant eligibility, Tournament structure, prize awards, and Participant conduct. These Rules also contain limitations of liability, license grants, and other legally binding contractual terms that affect Participant rights and obligations.</p>
